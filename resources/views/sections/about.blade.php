            <h2>Get to Know SGRMS: Guiding Students, Supporting Futures</h2>
            <p>At the heart of our school’s commitment to student well-being is the School Guidance Records Management
                System (SGRMS)—a smart and connected platform that helps us manage guidance services more efficiently.
                <br>
                With SGRMS, we streamline student records, schedule appointments with ease, and stay connected with
                parents through real-time updates. By reducing paperwork and simplifying processes, our guidance team
                can focus more on what truly matters: providing timely, meaningful support to every learner.
